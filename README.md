# CNN-BiLSTM_model_for_soft_hand_offline_online_test
The CNN-BiLSTM model outputs continuous angles of two joints, enabling continuous proportional control of the soft hand. The online experiment incorporates offline model loading, transfer learning fine-tuning, and real-time decoding of ultrasound signals to achieve synchronized proportional control with human-machine interaction.
